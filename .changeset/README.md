# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the
full documentation for it [in the repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

## How to add a changeset

Run `npx changeset` and follow the prompts. Each changeset describes a change to the package and its semver impact (patch, minor, major).
